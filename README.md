3. Implement a game timer to display elapsed time during gameplay, as shown in the design.
4. Add functionality to track and display the number of flips the player has made.
5. Create a "Start Over" button that resets the game, including the timer, flip counter, and card positions.
6. Add smooth flip animations for the cards when selected to enhance the user experience.
